TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
under the exercises, my code reading skill improved a lot on studying the error and the structure of coding, starting from define to return results.

From Exercise 1-4, it talks about the looping and using random numbers, which makes a lot of fun for coding. It also makes up my mind on the possibility of coding in playing numbers.
