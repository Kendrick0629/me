TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

The core of understanding recursion is to set a base case and a recursive case. The base case determines when to stop the recursion to avoid infinite loops.

The code shows how to encapsulate common logic (such as string replacement rules) into a single function. This approach improves readability and maintainability of the code and reduces repetitive substitution.
