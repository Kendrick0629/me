TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Starting to work on geopandas, to finalising the map.

One of the problems i am facing is about the different size of plot of burbs and the base map's size in my shapefile and also the CSV file.

The second one is about how to make link the index in geopandas' dataframe and csv data frame.
