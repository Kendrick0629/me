TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Input and output

By reading and parsing files and websites, you learned how to extract and process data from resources.

I learnt how to handle different types of data streams in your program, from reading inputs, processing the data to outputting the results, which helped in understanding the flow of data and how to convert and process it efficiently at various steps.

When interacting with the API and the file system, I encounter a variety of possible errors, and the hints in the tasks help me learn how to detect and handle these errors and improve the robustness of your code.
